![CudaKwiatki - Contact App Layout][screenshot-1]

## General Description

Although it might sound as a mistake - calling this 'an app', this was my first program I designed and coded to display on a phone screen.

[Udacity's course][udacity-course] first coding task: 
Simple, static, one-page app displaying some business information. Florist's data displayed in a more like a business card manner, layout only (\*.xml file).

## Main Goal

**Main Goals** of the task:
1. View groups and nesting layouts
2. Using padding/margin so the Views are not crammed up
3. First use of `drawables/` and `values/` folders (strings, colors, styles, dimens)

Check out my next app: [VolleyScore App][volley-score].
